Fully Responsive UI: The user interface is built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly experience across all devices.

Scalable MERN Architecture: A well-structured backend using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (Mongoose) for a scalable and maintainable codebase.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
Frontend
React.js (Vite): For building a fast and dynamic user interface.

Tailwind CSS: For modern, utility-first styling.

Axios: For making promise-based HTTP requests to the backend API.

Socket.IO Client: To establish and manage the real-time websocket connection.

Backend
Node.js & Express.js: For building the robust and scalable server-side application.

MongoDB (Mongoose): As the NoSQL database for storing user data, messages, and conversations.

Socket.IO: For enabling real-time, event-based communication between the client and server.

Cloudinary: For cloud-based image storage and management.

JWT & bcrypt: For secure user authentication and password hashing.

cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following variables:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Cloudinary Credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and set up the backend proxy.

cd ../frontend
npm install

In the frontend directory, create a .env file and add the URL of your backend server:

VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000

üöÄ Running the Application
Start the Backend Server
From the backend directory:

npm start

Start the Frontend Development Server
From the frontend directory:

npm run dev
